# PHP-Jack
(Tl;Dr: Blackjack built in php)
## Part of BeCode PHP Challenges
original challenge page : (https://github.com/becodeorg/ANT-Lamarr-5.34)
challenge type: learning
challenge goal: first time building experience with OOP (Object Oriented Programming) 
time alotted: 2 days. 
Coach called it a mighty spicy challenge for two days but they have provided us with quite a bit of resources and also the framework for the necessary classes for this project, so although spicy, it should be feasible. 
## Timeline
Day 1 : 
-Get familiar with OOP aspects of programming php.
-review and understand the code we've been given as part of this challenge so that I understand both what it does and what it's purpose is. 
-read the documentation for the different functions.
-try and get as much of the functionality required working. 
-in the end got about halfway done
-overcode the given code. 
Day 2: 
-finish the exercise
-needed some help with understanding $this, but think i understand the purpose now more or less. 
-focus today will be on getting the different functions working on the actual page. 
-gotten all basic functionality working 
-not all as clean as I would like it to be, but there has been some improvement. 


## Expected difficulties Day 1
There are a lot of steps involved, it's not immediately clear how much time every step could take. the requirements are quite well defined, but i might have to split up some steps so that i can create individual code for each. 

## Lessons
style-wise class__construct always before the other functions but after the properties. 
$this refers to something present in the class you're defining.
When making a function in a class using something defined in another you use following format -function name(Class $param)-
